The files in this directory are used to generate the payroll allocation entries for Spring.
They are:
- Chart of Accounts files
- Dept to Sub dept mapping file
- Emp allocations file
- Entity Tagging File


When you run AllocationsPayroll.py, it asks for these files as input.
Having these files separated from the program allows for modular changes by Spring Staff, reduces programming admin overhead, reduces overall code.
